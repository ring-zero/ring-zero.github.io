# Welcome to my blog.
I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong focus on malware analysis, reverse engineering, and digital forensics. This space serves as a personal platform where I share insights, experiments, and lessons learned as I continue to deepen my knowledge and skills in these areas.

# Disclaimer on Educational Code Samples
Any malware code and related scripts shared on this blog that I have written are authored solely for educational and proof-of-concept purposes. While these examples demonstrate techniques commonly studied in malware analysis and reverse engineering, they do not include functionality intended to harm, exploit, or target real-world systems, users, or organizations.

That said, as with many forms of technical research, it is possible that the concepts or code shared here could be adapted or misused by malicious actors. I do not condone or support any unethical use of this material. The intent of sharing is to promote learning, awareness, and defensive capability.
